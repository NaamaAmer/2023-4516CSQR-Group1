# 2023-4516CSQR-GroupOne - Analysis of Covid-19 Impacts
#### Covid-19 is one of the most important and impactful events of recent history. It carries with it the memories of lockdown and hospitals overflowing with people. It is one of the most widespread pandemics in history and has impacted the entire world. The response to Covid-19 varied greatly from country to country. The purpose of this presentation is to analyze the impact of Covid-19 and the response across continents.

# Why Did we choose this topic and its importance
#### As a group we have chosen to analyze Covid-19 data from its beginning until 1/1/2023. 
#### This topic is very important to analyze and understand, as this analysis can help minimize the impact of future pandemics by seeing the response times and efficiency at which Covid-19 was handled. 
#### We can find which countries handled Covid-19 in the best manner and replicate their measures, therefore minimizing deaths and lifelong complications. 
#### By finding these countries we can also see the methods they used to improve and update our collective response to whatever pandemic may arise in the future.
